# NMA_basic_code
This archive contains the codes for calculating normal modes from an atomic structure (PDB format) or a pseudoatomic structure (EM maps represented with a collection of 3D Gaussian functions).
The code for the NMA of atomic structures is a modified version of the ElNemo code (http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/elnemo/).
The code for the NMA of pseudoatomic structures has been developped by Florence Tama. 
These codes are used within the ContinuousFlex plugin of Scipion 3.
